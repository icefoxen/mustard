I dub this language Zan.

Pretty typical scripting language, I guess.  Dynamic typing, functional
elements as Haskell-y as I can make 'em...

Or just make it Lisp-y as hell.  As much as you can anyway.

Compiles to bytecode.  The bytecode is relatively high level, probably stack
based, has tagged types, etc...
